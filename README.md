## üå± How to Start This Project

Do not clone this repository! Just follow the instructions.

This exercise aims to consolidate all that has been learned in the previous three pentesting exercises to propose mitigation and prevention measures for the detected attacks. The goal is to develop a report that details the identified vulnerabilities, the exploitation techniques used, and recommendations to prevent future exploits.

This is the final project that will deepen your understanding of the pentesting world. The objective is to complete all phases of pentesting. This fourth phase focuses on Proposing How to Prevent Attacks.

### Requirements

- Complete the reconnaissance and exploitation pentesting reports.

### Suggested Tools

- **Exploit-DB**: For researching known vulnerabilities and exploits.
- **CVE Details**: For finding details and mitigation strategies for specific vulnerabilities.
- **Metasploit Framework**: Review the tools and modules used during exploitation.
- **Kali Linux**: Review the tools and commands used for scanning and enumeration.

## üìù Instructions

### Step 1: Review Previous Reports

- [ ] **Review the previous reports**: Ensure you are clear on the findings from the previous pentesting reports (v1 and v2).
- [ ] **Report v1**: Review of vulnerabilities detected during the reconnaissance phase.
- [ ] **Report v2**: Documentation of the exploitation of vulnerabilities and privilege escalation in both scenarios: the vulnerable machine and the vulnerable website.

### Step 2: Prevention Proposal

- [ ] **Analyze each vulnerability** detected and exploited in the previous reports.
- [ ] **Propose prevention measures**: Develop strategies to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced into the system.
  - **Examples**:
    - Secure Development: Implement secure coding practices.
    - Code Review: Establish a code review process to detect flaws before they reach production.
    - Security Policies: Establish policies to avoid unnecessary exposure of services or sensitive information.

### Step 3: Mitigation Proposal

- [ ] **Identify mitigation measures** for vulnerabilities that are already present in the system.
- [ ] **Develop practical solutions** that can be applied to reduce the impact of vulnerabilities.
  - **Examples**:
    - Security Patches: Apply updates and patches to fix vulnerabilities.
    - Security Configuration: Modify insecure configurations in servers, applications, and networks.
    - Network Segmentation: Isolate critical services to limit the impact of a potential attack.

### Step 4: Final Report Drafting

- [ ] **Prepare a structured report** that includes:
  - **Table of Contents**: A clear guide of sections and subsections of the report.
  - **Introduction**: Summary of the objectives and scope of the exercise.
  - **Detected Vulnerabilities**: List of all vulnerabilities exploited in previous exercises.
  - **Prevention Proposal**: Suggested strategies to prevent the introduction of new vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation Proposal**: Details of recommended solutions to mitigate existing vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation Analysis**: Evaluation of the effectiveness of the recommended mitigation measures.
  - **Potential Impact**: Reflection on the impact these measures could have on the overall security of the system.
  - **Conclusion**: Final reflection on the importance of prevention and ongoing security.

### Step 5: Report Submission

- [ ] **Submit the final report** with the proposed prevention and mitigation measures. Ensure to include screenshots, detailed descriptions, and any other resources that support your proposals.

- The report must be submitted in PDF format. Including links to tools and additional resources used in the analysis will be considered a plus.

## Conclusion

In this final exercise, you have consolidated your understanding of pentesting techniques by proposing measures to prevent and mitigate the attacks detected in the previous exercises. The use of tools and resources such as Exploit-DB and CVE Details has allowed you to delve into common vulnerabilities and their solutions. Your final report, which includes detailed prevention and mitigation proposals, is a testament to your ability to apply the knowledge gained in a practical context. This analysis not only reflects your competence in pentesting but also your commitment to continuous security and system improvement.
